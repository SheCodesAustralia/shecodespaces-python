# SheCodespaces for Python 

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

This repository contains a pre-configured codespace with Python 3.12, a lightweight desktop environment, and Visual Studio Code for the Web -- all accessible from a web browser.

This is all you need to get started building the Turtle Chomp game. :turtle:
